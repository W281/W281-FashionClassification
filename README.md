#### Problem Statement:

An e-commerce company is selling fashion items and they've received complaints that the image of the product doesn't match the product description. They need help reorganizing their image data so that they can represent their products accurately. Our job is to build a classifier that can label thousands of fashion images quickly so that the company can match the image to their product faster.
